# PASSAPPA Airline Reservation System

## Introduction
This project is a simple airline reservation system implemented in C. It allows users to reserve seats, cancel reservations, display records of all passengers, and save passenger data to a file for persistence.

## Features
- **Reserve a Seat**: Allows passengers to book a seat and enter their details (passport number, name, email).
- **Cancel Reservation**: Cancels an existing reservation using the passenger's passport number.
- **Display Records**: Displays details of all passengers with reserved seats.
- **Save Records**: Saves passenger details to a file for persistent storage.

## Requirements
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Windows environment (due to the use of `conio.h` and `Windows.h`)

## Code Overview
### Structure Definitions
- **passappa_airline**: A struct that stores passenger details including passport number, name, email, seat number, and a pointer to the next passenger in the list.

### Function Prototypes
- `void reserve(int x)`: Reserves a seat for a passenger.
- `void cancel()`: Cancels an existing reservation.
- `void display()`: Displays records of all passengers.
- `void savefile()`: Saves passenger records to a file.
- `void details()`: Collects passenger details.

### Main Function
- Displays a menu with options to reserve a seat, cancel a reservation, display records, and exit.
- Handles user input and calls the corresponding functions.

### Reservation Logic
- **First Reservation**: Allocates memory for the first passenger and collects their details.
- **Subsequent Reservations**: Adds new passengers to the end of the linked list until the seat limit (15 seats) is reached.

### Cancellation Logic
- **First Passenger**: If the first passenger is being cancelled, updates the head of the list.
- **Subsequent Passengers**: Searches for the passenger by passport number and removes them from the linked list.

### Display Logic
- Iterates through the linked list and prints details of all passengers.

### File Saving Logic
- Opens a file in write mode and saves details of all passengers to the file.

## Data Persistence
Passenger data is stored in a file named `passappa records`. The file is updated each time the program exits, saving the current state of reservations.

## Exception Handling
Basic error handling is included to manage invalid choices and file opening errors.
